# `scripts/`

Four entrypoints. Run them from the **repo root** with the venv active (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
and `PYTHONPATH="$PWD/BigVGAN:$PYTHONPATH"` exported. `tts.py` sets `PYTHONPATH` for its own
subprocess, but the others assume you've done it yourself.

Rough mental model: **`setup.sh`** gets you a working install (it calls **`download_weights.py`**);
**`selftest.py`** proves the install works end-to-end; **`tts.py`** is the user-facing driver you
actually reach for once it does.

---

## `setup.sh`

One-shot environment bootstrap. ~40 lines of bash. Runs `pip` inside whichever venv you have
active; does not create one for you.

**What it does**, in order:
1. Branches on `uname`:
   - **Linux** → `pip install torch==2.4.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121` (CUDA 12.1 wheels).
   - **macOS arm64** → same versions from stock PyPI (the arm64 wheels ship the Metal backend). Warns if `ffmpeg` isn't on `PATH`.
   - **macOS x86_64** → refuses with an explanation. PyTorch stopped publishing macOS x86_64 wheels after 2.2.2, so Intel Macs cannot run this.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` — installs IndicF5 (from its GitHub commit pin), transformers, vocos, x-transformers, librosa, etc.
3. Clones NVIDIA BigVGAN into `BigVGAN/` (it's a repo, not a pip package — no `setup.py` there).
4. Runs `scripts/download_weights.py` (see below).
5. **Re-asserts the torch pin.** `pip install -r requirements.txt` above will silently upgrade torch to 2.14 and torchaudio to 2.11 (via IndicF5's `torch>=2.0.0` constraint). This step reinstalls `torch==2.4.1 torchaudio==2.4.1 --no-deps` and fails loudly if the version slipped. Do not remove — see `CLAUDE.md` for why.
6. Prints the resolved backend by calling into `src/device.py`, so you can eyeball whether you got `cuda`, `mps`, or `cpu`.

**When to run:** once, after `git clone`. Re-run only if you want to refresh dependencies or you deleted `.venv/`.

**Doesn't do:** create the venv, export `PYTHONPATH`, install ffmpeg. Those are on you.

## `download_weights.py`

Sixteen lines. Uses `huggingface_hub.hf_hub_download` to pull four files from `prathoshap/vagdhenu` on Hugging Face into `models/`:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `voice_steer_ema_2026-06-17.pt` | DiT voice-steering fine-tune — the current production voice |
| `voice_armA_ema_2026-06-11.pt` | Alternate voice checkpoint (the "armA" variant); not used by default renders |
| `voc_bigvgan_EMA_2026-06-11.pth` | Fine-tuned BigVGAN-v2 vocoder |
| `vocab.txt` | IndicF5's tokenizer vocab, redistributed so you don't depend on the gated `ai4bharat/IndicF5` repo |

**Env vars:**
- `VAGDHENU_HF` — override the HF repo path (default `prathoshap/vagdhenu`).
- `CHAMP_ROOT` — override where files land (default `models/`, used by `src/render.py`).

**When to run:** called by `setup.sh`. Run standalone to re-download after `rm -rf models/` or when the checkpoints get updated on HF.

---

## `selftest.py`

Six-stage smoke harness (~340 lines). Each stage prints PASS/FAIL; `--stages 1 2 3` runs a subset.

| Stage | Needs weights? | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Environment & backend | no | Python version, torch version, platform, which backend `device.py` picked, `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK` armed, `ffmpeg` on `PATH`, `bigvgan` importable, voice + vocoder + bank + vocab files all present |
| 2. Kernel coverage | no | Re-runs 5 hot kernels in a **child process with the MPS fallback disabled**, so anything Metal actually lacks raises instead of silently falling back to CPU. Per-kernel verdict: `native` or `CPU-FALLBACK`. Kernels probed: `torch.stft` (mel front-end), `torch.istft` (vocos head), `torchaudio.MelSpectrogram`, `scaled_dot_product_attention` (DiT), `ConvTranspose1d` (BigVGAN). |
| 3. Text frontend digest | no | Runs `prep_text.py` on a canonical Devanagari input and prints a hash. Device-independent — the digest must match across platforms, catches accidental changes to the Deva → SLP1 → Kannada routing / visarga sandhi / anusvāra / daṇḍa rules. |
| 4. Single-shard render | **yes** | One clip through the full pipeline end-to-end. |
| 5. Batch render | **yes** | Multiple clips, exercises the model-loaded-once loop path used by `src/render.py`. |
| 6. Mel-distance compare | **yes** | With `--compare path/to/reference.wav`, measures spectral distance to a reference produced on another backend. Mel-distance, not md5 — the only comparison that means anything across backends (see `docs/MAC.md`, "Known differences from the GPU output"). |

**Flags:**
- `--stages 1 2 3` — run a subset.
- `--nfe 32` (default 64) — flow-matching steps for the render stages.
- `--outdir` — where renders land (default `out/`).
- `--compare path.wav` — reference wav for stage 6.

**When to run:** stages 1–3 are cheap and need no weights, so run them anytime you want a smoke test. Stages 4–6 for verifying that a new machine or a code change didn't break the render.

## `tts.py`

User-facing driver — the reason non-developers care about `scripts/`. Reads a UTF-8 shloka text
file, splits it on daṇḍa (`।`/`॥`) and newline boundaries, drives `src/render.py` for the whole
batch, and stitches the per-hemistich wavs into a single MP3 via `ffmpeg`.

```bash
python scripts/tts.py verse.txt                       # -> ./verse.mp3
python scripts/tts.py verse.txt -o /tmp/vande.mp3     # exact output path
python scripts/tts.py verse.txt --nfe 64 --seed 42    # override render params
python scripts/tts.py verse.txt --keep-wavs           # keep the raw hemistichs
```

**Flags:**
- `-o` / `--output` — output path (default: `<input-stem>.mp3` in current dir).
- `--format` — output format, `mp3` only for now.
- `--meter` — reference-bank key (default `anushtubh`). Must match a key in `src/reference_bank/bank.json`.
- `--nfe` — flow-matching steps (default 32 = serving; 64 = locked production config).
- `--seed` — per-clip seed (default 60). If a clip's RMS energy falls below threshold, `render.py` will advance the seed up to 4 times before giving up on that clip.
- `--keep-wavs` — copy the per-hemistich wavs into `<output-stem>_wavs/` alongside the mp3. Recommended for long batches so a crash during the ffmpeg concat doesn't lose the render.

**Notes:**
- Sets `PYTHONPATH` for the render subprocess itself, so you don't need to export it just to run this.
- Applies one `--meter` to *every* clip. For a text with mixed meters, either chunk it by meter or extend the driver.
- The temp workdir is deleted on exit — use `--keep-wavs` if you want to keep the raw output.

**Scaling to large texts** (hundreds of verses): chunk into per-chapter text files, `--keep-wavs`, loop:

```bash
for f in chapter_*.txt; do
  python scripts/tts.py "$f" --nfe 64 --keep-wavs -o "${f%.txt}.mp3"
done
```

`render.py` continues past failures (retries seeds up to 4×, then gives up on that clip), so **check the results after** — a shard with `FAIL=3/1600` won't be obvious from listening to the mp3.
